    I Don’t Know What Will Kill Us First: The Race War or What We’ve Done to the Earth
    Fatimah Asghar
    
    so I count my hopes: the bumblebees
    are making a comeback, one snug tight
    in a purple flower I passed to get to you;
    
    your favorite color is purple but Prince’s
    was orange & we both find this hard to believe;
    today the park is green, we take grass for granted
    
    the leaves chuckle around us; behind
    your head a butterfly rests on a tree; it’s been
    there our whole conversation; by my old apartment
    
    was a butterfly sanctuary where I would read
    & two little girls would sit next to me; you caught
    a butterfly once but didn’t know what to feed it
    
    so you trapped it in a jar & gave it to a girl
    you liked. I asked if it died. you say you like
    to think it lived a long life. yes, it lived a long life
