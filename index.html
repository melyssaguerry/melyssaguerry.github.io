    I Don’t Know What Will Kill Us First: The Race War or What We’ve Done to the Earth<br>

    so I count my hopes: the bumblebees<br>
    are making a comeback, one snug tight<br>
    in a purple flower I passed to get to you;<br><br>
    
    your favorite color is purple but Prince’s<br>
    was orange & we both find this hard to believe;<br>
    today the park is green, we take grass for granted<br><br>
    
    the leaves chuckle around us; behind<br>
    your head a butterfly rests on a tree; it’s been<br>
    there our whole conversation; by my old apartment<br><br>
    
    was a butterfly sanctuary where I would read<br>
    & two little girls would sit next to me; you caught<br>
    a butterfly once but didn’t know what to feed it<br><br>
    
    so you trapped it in a jar & gave it to a girl<br>
    you liked. I asked if it died. you say you like<br>
    to think it lived a long life. yes, it lived a long life
